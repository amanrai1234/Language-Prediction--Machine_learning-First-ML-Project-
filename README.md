# Project-1-Languages





I have imported the dataset to the jupyter notebook as the dataset is small and I started the coding 
process, I have commented using the markdown lines in you can remove them if the code does not 
execute.
The libraries that I have used are:

Sklearn

Random

Keras

Pandas

Matplotlib

Collections

To perform prediction I have choose the concept of linear regression as the linear regression concept 
is very simple and can predict the values and I have achieved an accuracy of 98 percent, apart from 
that I got 393/400 predictions right and I had evaluated the metrics using the concept of precision
and recall. I have observed around 98 percent precision and recall with about 100 epochs in the 
model
